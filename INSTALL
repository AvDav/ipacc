ipacc is a *nix-based daemon developed to collect consumed network traffic passing through Cisco router.
The information is kept in a structured way in a textual form and presented per days, months and years.

Here are the complete and detailed steps to get it working:
1. Enable rsh server on a router and specify the IP address and user of this machine in terminal configuration shell, e.g.:
Router#configure terminal
Router(config)#ip rcmd rsh-enable
Router(config)#ip rcmd remote-host root xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx root enable

2. Edit ipacc.conf configuration file.

3. Enable IP accounting output-packets on a desired interface of router:
Router#configure terminal
Router(config)#interface f0/0
Router(config-if)#ip accounting output-packets

4. Edit crontab file to run ipaccou when necessary. Also it is needed that a current working directory should be
given as a command line argument in crontab entry (e.g.: /home/avdav/ipacc/ipacc /home/avdav/ipacc).
When specifying a large amount of time interval in crontab, make sure if there is enough quantity 
of entries in the accounting database of the router. It is recommended to set ip accounting-threshold 
(512 entries is by default) to 32768 entries, e.g.:
Router#configure terminal
Router(config)#ip accounting-threshold 32768
